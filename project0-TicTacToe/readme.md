Iteration list:
1. Add computer level choice (not chess randomly but try to win)
2. Change icon
3. Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter
4. fireworks on background and music
5. Popup window (modal window) for congratulation
6. * **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
7. * **Use LocalStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
8. Refactor code:
1> **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
2> **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
9. Finish readme.md
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
10. **Support custom board sizes**: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
