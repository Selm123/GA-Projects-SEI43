7. Change music source to online to make the project smaller
8. Add pvp mode

** Do finally:
1. Make sure the display is ok for different resolutions: change to view height?
2. Refactor code:

2> **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
3. Finish readme.md
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
